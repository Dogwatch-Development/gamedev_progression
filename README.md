# Game Development Progression Path

Link to main site: [www.dogwatch.dev](https://www.dogwatch.dev)

This document outlines an AI generated step-by-step progression to learn game development using **Raylib** and **C++**, focusing on retro-style games inspired by old consoles like the Vectrex, Atari, and Commodore systems. The goal is to incrementally build the skills necessary to create and release games while avoiding being overwhelmed by new concepts and thought patterns.

   - **Learn:** Basic rendering, input handling, and collision detection.

2. **Collect the Dots** (Inspired by "Dot Eater")
   - The player controls a dot that must collect smaller dots randomly appearing on the screen while avoiding a moving enemy dot.
   - **Learn:** Spawning mechanics, basic AI, and scoring.

3. **Avoid the Walls** (Inspired by "Avoid the Walls")

11. **Cross the Road** (Inspired by "Frogger")
    - The player guides a character across a busy road and a river with moving hazards.
    - **Learn:** Timed movement, pattern-based obstacles, and level progression.

12. **Jumping Game** (Inspired by "Platformer Prototype")
    - Create a simple platformer where the player jumps between platforms and avoids hazards.
    - **Learn:** Gravity, jumping mechanics, and basic level design.

13. **Landing Game** (Inspired by "Lunar Lander")
    - The player controls a lander that must safely touch down on a platform.
    - **Learn:** Physics-based movement, precision controls, and fuel management.

14. **Top-Down Racing** (Inspired by "Top-Down Racer")
    - A top-down racing game where the player competes against AI or a timer.
    - **Learn:** Pathfinding, track design, and speed mechanics.

15. **Tank Game** (Inspired by "Tank Battle")
    - Two players control tanks that shoot at each other in a destructible environment.
    - **Learn:** Destructible terrain, projectile mechanics, and multiplayer gameplay.

16. **Maze Game** (Inspired by "Maze Game")
    - The player navigates a maze to collect items while avoiding enemies.
    - **Learn:** Maze generation, pathfinding, and stealth mechanics.

17. **Rescue Game** (Inspired by "Defender")
    - The player controls a ship that must rescue stranded humans while fighting off waves of enemies.
    - **Learn:** Scrolling environments, rescue mechanics, and wave-based gameplay.

18. **Segmented Enemy Game** (Inspired by "Centipede")
    - The player shoots at a segmented enemy that moves down the screen, breaking into smaller parts when hit.
    - **Learn:** Segment-based enemies, dynamic difficulty, and screen wrapping.

19. **Room Game** (Inspired by "Berserk")
    - The player navigates rooms filled with enemies and must shoot or avoid them to survive.
